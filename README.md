# NatureDB, Yet another natural history collection management system

The "NaturalDB" is an open-source platform designed to manage, collect, and showcase natural history specimens and biodiversity data. This platform supports institutions in cataloging, curating, and publish the collections to other biodiversity information standards, like [Darwin core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/).

There are much things to do, this README generated by chatgpt and need more introduction.
