# NatureDB, Yet Another Natural History Collection Management System

The "NaturalDB" is an open-source platform designed to manage, collect, and showcase natural history specimens and biodiversity data. This platform supports institutions in cataloging, curating, and publish the collections to other biodiversity information standards, like [Darwin core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/).

The following are some online examples:

database table: site add domain field

insert site admin account

7. Visit `http://foo.bar.com:5000` in your browser to access the platform.

## Usage

1. **Browse Specimens**: Visit the homepage of the platform to search and browse natural history specimens.
2. **Pages**: Visit static pages like: about us, contact and dynamic pages: news, related links...
3. **API Usage**: not ready.

## Data Management (admin)

1. **Cataloging Specimens**: Use the collection management interface to catalog new specimens, including the input of metadata such as species name, collection date, location, and more.
2. **Curating Collections**: Organize specimens into collections, adding tags and categories to facilitate easy retrieval and browsing.
3. **User Roles and Permissions**: Assign roles such as administrator, curator, or researcher to manage who can add, edit, or view specific parts of the collection.
4. **Reporting**: Generate reports on the number of specimens, their condition, and other collection-related metrics to help manage the inventory and share insights with stakeholders.
